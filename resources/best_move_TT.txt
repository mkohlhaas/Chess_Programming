=====================================
Another improvement would be to save the best move on the tables hash.
At this moment your tables hash allow you to cut the search,
but you don't have the advantage of having saved the best move.
To save the best move you simply have to create a bestmove variable
at the beginning of the search, when you find a value that improves alpha
then you simply make bestmove as the move you are currently making.
Then when you write in the tables you send bestmove as you send for example the score.
If you have saved a move in the position you want to check,
even if it doesn't reach the required depth, you can simply return it with a return or a pointer.
This move can then be sorted in the first position of the list in a similar
way to what you do with follow_pv. I don't know how much you lose by not saving
the best move for sorting, but maybe 50% of the profit from the hash tables.
