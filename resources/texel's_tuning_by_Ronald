repeat while sum of errors still lowers
	for each tunable parameter
		increase parameter by one
		for each testposition
			calc eval
			calc error
			sum error			
		fe
		if sum error is lowered then next parameter
		else
			decrease parameter by one
			for each testposition
				calc eval
				calc error
				sum error			
			fe
		end else	
	fe
end repeat	

So you increase the parameter by one and see if it's better,
if not lower it by one and see it's better.
If still not better then keep the original value.
Because some parameters are dependent on other parameters,
it can happen that a parameter doesn't change anymore,
but a few iterations later changes again.

Finally your question about positions.
You can get positions from multiple sources,
including generating your own.
2 things are very important concerning the positions:
- diversity (to cover as many parameters as possible)
- Correctness of the final outcomes of the game of the position (Win/Draw/Loss)
It might take some time to calculate the final outcome of the positions
(the longer time control the better the outcome will be).
