=====================================

Your evaluation here consists of material and positional (now only pst).
To perform tapered evaluation you have interpolated the material once and 12 times
(for each kind of piece) when calculating pst.

If you keep adding new evaluation values you will have to keep interpolating.
All this talking about code, because if I am not wrong if at the beginning of
the game there are 32 pieces, you end up "interpolating 64 times",
2 times for each piece  (material + pst).

You can do everything with only "one interpolation",
maybe the result will be the same and surely you will not gain much in speed
(for the moment because imagine that you keep adding up evaluation terms),
but your code will be much easier.

You could do it:
1. Calculate values for each piece:
     calculate score_opening_material and score_endgame_material
     calculate score_opening_positional(pst+...) and score_endgame_positional(pst+...)

2. After going through all the pieces we can simply calculate the total:
    score_opening = score_opening_material + score_opening_positional
    score_endgame = score_endgame_material + score_endgame_positional

3. Before leaving the evaluation you make the interpolation between score_opening
   and score_endgame if you are in the middle game and if not you return score_opening
   or score_endgame as the case may be.
