Let's assume that white plays, you get wtime and winc.
At wtime I take a security time to avoid problems with the GUI or Internet.

time_total = wtime - time_safety (time_safety is a user configurable option, default is 50 ms)
inc = winc

To calculate the time I have for the move, as we are in a game where we don't
know how many moves are necessary for the time control, I suppose we still have
to make 30 moves (movestogo).

time_move = time_total / 30 + inc

The problem is that the engine does not go out fast enough from the search and
usually exceeds the time per move, so when it takes many moves it ends up losing.
To avoid this I do:

if (inc > 0 && time_total < 5*inc) time_move = 75*inc/100

In this case if the total time is less than 5s I only use 75% of the time of the increment,
so the engine would always have a reserve time of about 5s and it would be complicated to lose.
