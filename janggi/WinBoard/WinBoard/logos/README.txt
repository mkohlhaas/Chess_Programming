This folder is where WinBoard will search logo bitmaps for
human users, and for Internet Chess Servers, when the option
/autoLogo=true. (The logos for engines will be taken from the
engine folder as specified by the /fd or /sd option, from
the file "logo.bmp" in that folder.)

To be recognized, the name of the file should be xxx.bmp,
where xxx is either the name of the ICS as given in the
/icshost command (or selected in the startup dialog), or
the name of the user as it appears in the WinBoard title
bar. For instance, on my Windows XP laptop I am known as
user "hgm", so WinBoard will use the logo hgm.bmp for me.
(This name can be set through the "Edit -> Enter User Name"
menu when you are not satisfied with the name the operating
system assigns you.)
