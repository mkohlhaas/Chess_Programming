Let's say you're a freelance software engineer,
who wants to make money by creating web scrapers for customers.
Just a hypothetical situation, as an example.
You would like to know how much you will earn, so you ask around.
After some asking and prodding, you come to the conclusion:

"When I just start out, I can't ask more than 10 dollars per hour because I'm a rookie."
"But at the end of my carreer, after 40 years, I'll be able to ask 200 dollars/hour
because of my massive experience."

But... I want to know what I will earn after 25 years. Or after 10 years.

So we make this into a formula.
(And we assume that your asking price can raise with the same amount each year.)

years -> x
dollars -> y

When you just start out, you have 0 years of experience and you will earn 10 dollars per hour.

So: (0, 10)

At the end of your career you have 40 years of experience, and you will earn 200 dollars per hour.

So: (40, 200)

How much will you earn after 24 years of working?
We don't know, but we can interpolate it.
If you would plot the points (0, 10) and (40, 200) on an xy-axis,
you can draw a straight line through them.
The formula for this line is
(and this formula can be solved for any straight line for which you know two points):

y = (a * x) + b

The first point is (0, 10); so if x = 0, y must be 10:

10 = a * 0 + b (<- if x is 0, the result is 0 for any 'a')
10 = 0 + b (<- and thus 'b' must be 10)

y = ax + 10... so what must 'a' be? We know both x and y, and we also know b, so...

200 = (a * 40) + 10
200 - 10 = a * 40
190 = a * 40
190 / 40 = a
a = 4.75

Therefore:

y = (4.75 * x) + 10

Let's check, with x = 0, when you start out:
y = 4.75 * 0 + 10
y = 0 + 10
y = 10 dollars/hour.

And when you are working 40 years:
y = 4.75 * 40 + 10
y = 190 + 10
y = 200 dollars/hour.

Cool. Seems to work.

So now we can interpolate how much you will earn when you're working for 24 years:

y = 4.75 * 24 + 10
y = 114 + 10
y = 124 dollars/hour

This is interpolation.
